First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Firstname Lastname, for directing my PhD studies. I would also like to thank my colleagues and friends who helped me to realize the results presented here and to enjoy the period of my studies. 
Last, but not least, I wish to thank my wife and family for their constant love and support.
